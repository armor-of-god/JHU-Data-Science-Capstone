This application is the capstone requirement for the **Coursera Data Science Course**. The objective of this project is to develope a predictive language model using a shiny appplication to predict the next word of user input, similar to how a smart phone keyboards function today using the technology of Swiftkey.

### How to Use
1. Upon initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be displayed at the "Prediction for Next Word."
2. Enter a partially complete sentence on the left-hand panel to initiate the next word prediction.


### Results
1. Next word predicted is shown in the "Prediction for Next Word" textbox.
2. Additional information is provided on which n-gram was performed to complete the prediction.
